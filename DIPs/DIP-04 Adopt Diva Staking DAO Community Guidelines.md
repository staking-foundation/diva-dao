# DIP-04: Adopt Diva Staking DAO Community Guidelines

## Description

The Diva Staking DAO was launched 3 months ago, and has now gone through several Drafts and Voting Proposals.

A set of Community Guidelines was proposed and used in practice, and has been recently updated with changes like:

- Deprecating the "DCP, DIP, DUP" terminology in favor of a simpler unified DIP-XX + Low/Medium/High Impact classification
- Updating all values to the most recent voting periods, which were modified by DUP-01
- Clarifications on the Request For Comments step
- Writing improvements

This proposal proposes to ratify the following document as the current Diva Staking DAO Community Guidelines.

- [Github's Pull Request](https://github.com/staking-foundation/diva-dao/pull/3)
- [Discord discussion](https://discord.com/channels/1041618287500460083/1133466096763158629)
- [Forum discussion & temperature check](https://commonwealth.im/divastaking/discussion/12343-voting-periods)

With this proposal passing, the DAO resolves to adopt the following Community Guidelines:

```
# Diva Staking DAO INITIAL COMMUNITY GUIDELINES 

## Section 1. Definition and Purpose

The Diva Staking Decentralized Autonomous Organization (the ‘Diva Staking DAO’) is an unincorporated association of individuals, entities, associations and/or other persons or groups of persons holding the DIVA token AND having completed a process referred to as “delegation”. The Diva Staking DAO is not intended to, and shall not be deemed to, be a legal person or have a legal personality separate from the DAO Members. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the DAO is not intended to be, and shall not be deemed to be, a partnership.

The primary objective of the Diva Staking DAO is to curate and maintain the publicly available software resources known as the Diva Staking protocol. It is important to note that the Diva Staking DAO does not engage in administering or managing the Diva Staking protocol in any way. Instead, its mission is focused on enhancing the accessibility, efficiency, and resilience of the blockchain interaction commonly referred to as 'staking' through the utilization of non-proprietary software.

## Section 2. Governance Tokens

Diva Staking DAO governance tokens (the "DIVA Tokens" or "Governance Tokens") means the effectively delegated tokens associated with the Diva Staking protocol and referred to in https://github.com/staking-foundation and designated as Delegated DIVA, D-DIVA, or any other designation the Diva Staking DAO may find appropriate from time to time.

## Section 3. Excluded Tokens 

DIVA Tokens that have not been revocably delegated, either through self-delegation or delegation to third parties, using the designated governance smart contract of the Diva Staking DAO, are not considered as Diva Staking DAO governance tokens. These tokens do not possess the authority to submit any type of DAO proposal or participate in the voting process for any DAO proposals.

## Section 4. DAO Resolutions.

As per the token amount thresholds outlined in Section 5 below, every holder of Governance Tokens holds the right to submit and participate in the voting of proposals, referred to as 'DAO Proposals.' Once a proposal is duly approved by the Governance Token holders and has not been invalidated by the DAO governance mechanism, it is recognized as a 'DAO Resolution'.

## Section 5. DAO Proposals. 

Proposals may be submitted by any D-DIVA Token holder holding **at least 1 Million D-DIVA Tokens** subject to any applicable threshold, and/or any frequency restriction or other parameter designated by the Diva Staking DAO through the passage of a Diva Improvement Proposal (as defined below).

There are three types of Proposals based on risk and potential impact levels:

1.	**Low Impact** - intended to distribute governance power among communities, sealing strategic partnerships, etc.
2.	**Medium Impact** - aiming to adapt or modify a configurable feature of the Diva Staking protocol.
3.	**High Impact** - complex proposals aiming to update core infrastructure and require some code implementation.

## Section 6. DAO Proposals Quorum and Thresholds. 

In order for a Proposal to be valid a **Quorum of at least 10 Million D-DIVA Tokens** is required (as of the time of this writing).

The thresholds initially set for each kind of proposal are as follows, 

- **Low Impact** - more than 50% of favourable votes
- **Medium Impact** - more than 66% of favourable votes
- **High Impact**- more than 75% of favourable votes

## Section 7. DAO Proposals Procedures

Any DAO proposal starts with an idea, which can discussed organically by the community. Several channels in use are:

- [Diva's Discord](https://discord.gg/diva)
- [Commonwealth forum](https://commonwealth.im/divastaking/discussions)

Once the idea start to formalize, it should follow the steps below.

### 7.1. Request For Comments (RFC) / Temperature Check

In order for a proposal to be formally considered by the community, a Request for Comments and Temperature Check must be carried.

This process has two parts:

- A **Request For Comments (RFC)** discussion thread to collect community feedback.
- A **non-binding poll** to evaluate if the proposal gains enough interest and community support.

The [Commonwealth forum](https://commonwealth.im/divastaking/discussions) is a good way to do this, as it allows for both discussion and off-chain voting, but any openly accessible platform or channel can be used.

The RFC is intended to provide all necessary information and collect feedback to prepare the formal proposal which would later be submitted for its voting and subsequent approval or rejection.

Any member of the community at large may open a thread in the Diva Forum outlining the proposal which needs to be debated or any suggestion which may be deemed as beneficial to the community at large. 

The RFC shall contain at least the following: 

- **Title**: RFC + Proposal title.
- **Description**: Short and concise description of the proposal.
- **Rationale**: why the proposal is necessary and what benefit will bring to the community.
- **Tentative classification**: Low, Medium or High Impact proposal.
- **A non-binding community poll** to indicate the level of support the proposal may have.

### 7.2. DAO Proposal submission

Proposals can only be submitted by those which have **at least 1 Million D-DIVA Tokens** (as of the time of this writing) and it implies an on-chain transaction.

Proposals can be submitted on [Tally](https://tally.xyz/gov/diva) by selecting “Create a new proposal”.

The proposal shall include the following structure: 

- **DIP code**: Proposals start at DIP-01, DIP-02, and continue sequentially.
- **Title**: Short name of the proposal 
- **Classification**: Low, Medium or High Impact
  - *Low Impact* proposals shall include a short description of the proposed action to be taken
  - *Medium Impact* proposals shall include a risk assessment of the proposed implementation of such proposal and the executable code (Tally provides a list of executable functions which can be implemented) 
  - *High Impact* proposals shall include a thorough description of the technical features aimed to be implemented, executable code and test cases. 

Any proposal shall include a copyright waver. Further, any code or material included in any proposal shall be open sourced and released to the public domain without any restriction whatsoever.

### 7.3. Proposals Voting Delay

Once the proposal has been created “on-chain” there is a waiting period (voting delay). During that period token holders can still delegate their tokens (either self delegate or delegate to third parties). Such delegation will affect the necessary quorum for a proposal to become valid as only Delegated DIVA tokens are accounted for any governance purpose. 

**The voting delay period is set to 2 days** as of the time of this writing.

### 7.4. Proposal Voting Period

Once the voting delay period has elapsed, all the proposals have a voting period upon submission under which any Delegated DIVA token holders can vote in favour or object.

**The voting period is set to 5 days** as of the time of this writing.

After such period has elapsed, considering **a valid quorum of 10 Million D-DIVA Tokens** (as of the time of this writing) has been met and the correspondent voting threshold has been exceeded the proposal shall be considered passed and will become a DAO Resolution

## Section 8. DAO Resolutions

### 8.1. Queueing for Execution and Cooldown Period

Upon successful confirmation that the corresponding threshold and quorums have been met, an on-chain transaction is required to set the approved DAO Resolution in queue for its execution, starting a Cooldown Period.

The current Cooldown Periods (as of the time of this writing) are:

- **Low and Medium Impact** proposals: 9 days.
- **High Impact** proposals: 14 days.

The Cooldown Period is designed to provide a window for cancelling malicious proposals by submitting a Cancellation Proposal.

During the Cooldown period, an approved DAO Resolution still can be disputed and cancelled, as detailed in Section 9.

### 8.2 Execution 

Once the Cooldown Period has elapsed, anybody can execute the transaction to implement a DAO resolution.

As the required functions to effectively implement the desired outcome have been previously registered within the proposal, the execution of said transaction does not alter in any manner the terms of the DAO Resolution. 

## Section 9. Disputes

Any DAO Resolution can be challenged before it is executed due security considerations such as governance attacks or fraudulent code implementation. 

In order to challenge a DAO Resolution, a Cancellation Proposal must be submitted by a community participant counting with a governance power of **at least 1 Million D-DIVA Tokens** (as of the time of this writing).

The Proposal shall clearly specify “Cancellation Proposal” and set clearly and consciously what is the harm prevented by the cancellation and other remedies proposed to avoid further damage to the Diva Staking protocol and or community. 

In order to be valid a cancellation proposal requires a quorum of at least 10 Million D-DIVA Tokens and more than 50% of favourable votes (as of the time of this writing).

The execution of said Cancellation Proposal can be fulfilled after 2 hours cooldown period after its approval.
